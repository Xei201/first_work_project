# Library of Ruina
My first work projects 

In this project, I created an application to serve the work of the library. It allows you to store data about authors, books by authors, physical copies of books and the fact that these books were booked and their access status.

The application has a division into 2 levels. 
The first level is for ordinary users, lists of authors, books and data on personal bookings are available on it.

The second level is intended for library staff, who can make adjustments to the description of authors and books, add new authors and works, make new reservations, correct and complete old reservations.
